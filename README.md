# Team6Hackathon
# Inspiration
Our inspiration comes from seeing all the perfectly good food being wasted from supermarkets to hawker centers while there are many individuals and families struggling to get access to proper food. Therefore, we have decided to come up with an application to help connect those businesses to individuals facing food insecurity reducing food wastage and helping the community.

# What it does
Our application would allow organization to register and donate food that they have produced in surplus to the donation location. Individuals who are in need can also register to request for food, allowing the system to match the Individuals to food that matches their needs and diet. There are also volunteers that can register to help to deliver food from the donation location to the Individual's location.

# How we built it
We created the application using Oracle Apex which allows us to create a database and a web interface. By creating the web interface, it would allow us to enter in data by the different types of users allowing the website to process and match the right food to the right user based on the different food restrictions they might have.

# Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we have are that we have to adapt and learn how to use new software such as the Oracle Apex. It was difficult navigate through the interface at first and create what we planned to create.

# What we learned
We have learned new skills like using Oracle Apex to create our own web application.

# What's next for FoodLink
We plan to use better algorithms to better match the food donated to the people in need using factors like their age, number of food restrictions and income level, and better prioritize who should get their food first.
